A simple GitHub client.

An exercise of using some modern libraries together.

#### News
This project is now rewritten in Kotlin language - except some thin layers around:
Dagger 2, Retrofit 2, Realm - these libraries do not like Kotlin much (yet).

#### Features

* Fetching and displaying any user public repositories
* Fetching and displaying all user repositories (after login)
* Basic authentication (also two-factor authentication)
* Offline browsing (once visited users data is saved in local data base)
* MVP architecture
* Uses the the https://developer.github.com/v3 API
* Material design (kind of..)
* Cool layout for wide screens (720dp or more) :-)

#### Some interesting libraries used

* Retrofit 2
* Dagger 2
* RxJava
* RxBinding
* RxRelay
* Realm
* Picasso
* Paperwork
* Material Dialogs
* My Blocks
